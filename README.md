# bioit-algorithms

Hi!

These are my solutions of the most popular algorithms used in bioinformatics.
All of them were written by me as school projects & their aim is only to show my skills.

I'm constantly learning to improve myself in Python, that's why most of them contain lots of explanatory comments.
Projects are arranged in order of increasing level of advancement - from basic (B) to more advanced (J).

You can also find the 'missing' project A in priorityqueues (another repository).

Please, do not copy.
